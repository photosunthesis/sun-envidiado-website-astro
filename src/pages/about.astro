const aboutMeText = `I'm Sun, a software developer from Manila who builds software mainly for work and sometimes for fun.

My coding journey has been a bit all over the place. It began with C# and .NET, moved into JavaScript and Vue.JS, then detoured through PHP and Laravel before I eventually landed in Flutter. Flutter is excellent for building Android and iOS apps; the cross-platform developer experience there is strong. For desktop and web, the story is more mixed and there are some trade-offs.

When I'm not writing code, you'll usually find me gaming (currently hooked on Helldivers 2), singing karaoke with friends, or doomscrolling on TikTok for far too long. I cook, though I'd like to get seriously better at it. Someday I hope to have a proper kitchen and quality utensils so I can work toward making Michelin-star quality meals.

This site leans into a terminal/vim aesthetic because I've always loved that retro hacker-movie vibe from the 90s. Ironically, I actually use VS Code — the go-to editor for normal people — but the look is my nod to that era when computers felt more mysterious.

I built this site to share projects, ideas, and random thoughts about code, gaming, and life in general. It's a small corner of the internet about me.`;
