const aboutMeText = `Hey, I'm Sun, a software developer from Manila, Philippines. I like building stuff, and I wanted my own little corner in this vast, chaotic, amazing internet, so I built this site.

I've been coding for a while now, and my dev journey's been all over the placeâ€”I began with web development using C# and .NET, then got into Vue and JavaScript, somehow ended up in the PHP world with Laravel, and now I found myself focusing on Flutter development. It's pretty great how you can build for different platforms with one codebase.

When I'm not coding, I'm usually gaming (totally addicted to Helldivers 2 at the moment) or doing karaoke with friends. I spend way too much time scrolling through TikTok, have a soft spot for Lucky Me's chicken sotanghon despite knowing it's terrible for me, and I can't pick between cats and dogs because I love them both equally.

I gave this site a terminal/vim vibe because I think that aesthetic looks cool and techy, even though I still use VS Code like a normal person. I got into the retro-minimal look after switching from Windows to Linux. This is where I'll post about coding, games, and random things I find interesting.`;
