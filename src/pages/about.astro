const aboutMeText = `I'm Sun, a software developer from Manila who builds software mainly for work and sometimes for fun.

My coding journey has been a bit all over the place. It began with C# and .NET, moved into Vue where I loved its simplicity, then detoured through PHP and Laravel, and eventually landed me in the world of Flutter. What keeps me hooked on Flutter is that moment when a single piece of code runs seamlessly across mobile, web, and desktop. It's not perfect, but there's something magical about that cross-platform promise.

When I'm not writing code, I'm usually gaming (currently hooked on Helldivers 2), singing karaoke with friends, or scrolling way too long on TikTok. I also have a soft spot for Lucky Me chicken sotanghon, even though instant noodles and MSG are about as unhealthy as it gets.

This site leans into a terminal/vim aesthetic because I've always loved that retro hacker-movie vibe from the 90s. Ironically, I actually use VS Code — the go-to editor for normal people — but the look is my nod to that era when computers felt more mysterious.

I built this space as my own little corner of the internet — a place that's fully mine, where I can share projects, ideas, games I'm obsessed with, and the occasional random thought. It's my digital home on the web.`;
