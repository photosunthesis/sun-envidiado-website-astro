*Not actually leaving, just not posting anymore. 

I deleted every single post, but I’m not deleting my account. People I care about are still there, and I still want to keep in touch. I’ll be around to watch stories and say hi, just not to post photos or updates to the feed anymore.

## What Happened

Instagram used to be about photos from your friends. Now it’s mostly ads, random Reels, and “suggested” posts from accounts I don't recognize or follow. By the time I actually see something from someone I know, it’s already days old. The algorithm does all the deciding, and it sucks at it.

The app feels like an awkward blend of Facebook, TikTok, and Snapchat, with a growing number of features that aren't really useful. I especially miss the simple square photo grid, but they removed it years ago.

These days I mostly just swipe through people's stories, which is basically Snapchat’s feature copied into Instagram, only with more ads. At least I still see stuff from people I actually know.

## Moving On

All I wanted was a place to share photos and little life updates for friends and family. But the app isn’t really built for that anymore. It’s built to keep people scrolling.

So I’m posting here on my own website instead. No algorithm deciding what shows up, no ads in between. Just my stuff, in order, the way it should be.

And if you’re someone I know — hey, you found me. You won’t see my face on Instagram anymore, but I’m glad you made it here. Welcome to my corner of the internet.
