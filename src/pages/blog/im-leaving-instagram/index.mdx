\*Not actually leaving, just not posting anymore.

I nuked my feed. Every single post is gone. I'm not deleting the account itself because, let's be real, everyone I know is still there and I need the DM access. I'll still be lurking in the stories and replying to messages, but the days of me feeding the algorithm are over.

## What Happened

Remember when Instagram was just photos of your friends' lunch? Now it's a slot machine of ads, random Reels, and "suggested" content from people I've never heard of. By the time I actually see a post from a friend, it's three days old. The app makes the decisions now, not me.

It feels like an identity crisis. It's trying to be TikTok, Snapchat, and Facebook all at once; it's succeeding at none of them. I miss the simple grid, the chronological feed, the actual _photos_.

Now I mostly just tap through stories, but even that feels like wading through commercials. At least I still see the people I actually follow there.

## Moving On

I just wanted a quiet place to dump photos and life updates for the people who actually care. Instagram isn't built for that anymore. It's built for retention metrics and ad serve times. So I'm doing it here instead. No algorithm shuffling the deck, no ads selling me drop-shipped garbage. Just my stuff, in order, the way it should be.

You won't catch me on the main feed anymore, but I'm glad you're here. Welcome to my little corner of the internet.
