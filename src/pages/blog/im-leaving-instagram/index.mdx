*Not actually leaving, just not posting anymore. 

I deleted every single post on Instagram, but I'm not deleting my account. People I care about are still there, and I still want to keep in touch. I'll be around to watch stories and say hi, just not to post photos or updates to the feed anymore.

## What Happened
 
Instagram used to be about photos from your friends. Now it's mostly ads, random Reels, and “suggested” posts from accounts I don't recognize or follow. By the time I actually see something from someone I know, it's already days old. The algorithm does all the deciding, and it sucks at it.

The app feels like an awkward blend of Facebook, TikTok, and Snapchat, with a growing number of features that aren't really useful. I especially miss the simple square photo grid, but they removed it years ago.

These days I mostly swipe through people's stories, but even that's annoying with the buttload of ads. Though at least I still see posts from people I actually know.

## Moving On

I wanted a place to share photos and little life updates for friends and family. Instagram isn't really built for that anymore. It's built to keep people scrolling. So I'm posting here on my own website instead. No algorithm deciding what shows up, no ads in between. Just my stuff, in order, the way it should be.

If you're someone I know — hey, you found me. You won't see my face on Instagram anymore, but I'm glad you made it here. Welcome to my corner of the internet.
