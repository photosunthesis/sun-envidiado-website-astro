For as long as I've been gaming, I've always played PVP games.

It started with Special Forces, an FPS that was popular in the early 2000s (which feels ancient now damn). From there it was Crossfire, then Dota (the OG Dota, a custom map in Warcraft III), and eventually CS. It was CSGO back then, CS2 now. CS was my game for a pretty long while.

The whole time, it was all about the grind. Climbing the ladder, chasing rank, the endless sweat. But let's be real, I'm not the best of the best. I'm no Faker or s1mple, and I never will be. That peak is unreachable for someone like me.

And honestly? Even if I somehow made it up there, it wouldn't mean anything. It gives me no real value. If people want to dedicate their lives to that grind, more power to them. But I'm done with it.

## One last try

I did give it one more shot with Arc Raiders. The game is solid, and it was fun for a bit. But the hook didn't set like it used to. Before I knew it, I found myself drifting back to Helldivers 2 instead. Then I picked up and finished Bayonetta, and now I'm deep into Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. None of them PVP, and I don't miss it.

## What I'm playing now

I still love multiplayer games, just co-op now. Helldivers 2 has become my main game. I keep coming back to it because it's chaotic, dumb fun. It's refreshing to work with teammates against a common enemy instead of sweating against randos who treat every match like a tournament final.

When I'm not spreading managed democracy, I'm enjoying story-driven games. And you know what? They're actually fun. Who knew, right? The stories are good, the worlds are immersive, and the gameplay can still be just as hard as any ranked match. The only difference is when I mess up, the enemies don't type toxic trash in the chat.

Maybe this is just my "unc" phase kicking in. I'm almost 30 (26 as of writing, but close enough). I've got bills, groceries, and taxes to worry about now. The endless PVP grind doesn't hit the same anymore when there are actual things in life worth grinding for.
