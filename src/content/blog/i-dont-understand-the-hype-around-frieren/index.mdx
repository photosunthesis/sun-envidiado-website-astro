So, anime thoughts.

I follow the _Sousou no Frieren_ manga and I've always thought it was super interesting. Naturally, I was glad to hear that it got an anime adaptation. 

But seeing it get _that_ much attention? That was surprising to me.

And honestly, I don't understand it.

## Good, but not *that* good

Don't get me wrong, _Sousou no Frieren_ is good. But it's not _that_ good. 

I just don't get the massive hype surrounding it. Sure, the premise is interesting, but to me, it was just that, interesting and fun; like, it's nothing special, and the overall plot is just okay.

And I know I'm gonna get hate for this, but I thought the characters, a lot of them, are kinda not as interesting. 

## That's just me though

But yeah, sure, the animation is crazy insane amazing, I guess. But outside of the beautiful visuals, I just don't get the hype.

Maybe it's just me, or maybe it just didn't hit me the same way it hit everyone else.
